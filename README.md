# superSalad
Raw food detection and recipe recommendation app (Insight 2018a DS Project)

I created this app during my time as an Insight Data Science Fellow.  The project conceptualized during the first week of the fellowship, and the app was developed during the second and third weeks.  

The app is currently hosted at www.supersalad.site

Enjoy!
